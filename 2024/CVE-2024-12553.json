This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of GeoVision GV-ASManager. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, default guest credentials may be used.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the GV-ASWeb service. The issue results from the lack of authorization prior to allowing access to functionality. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise.
