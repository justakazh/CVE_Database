This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Wacom Center. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. \n\nThe specific flaw exists within WTabletServicePro.exe. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to create an arbitrary file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-25359."
